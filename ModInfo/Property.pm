=head1 Devel::ModInfo::Property

Devel::ModInfo::Property - Defines a particular value in a Perl module that can be 
accessed and possibly updated

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Not meant to be used outside the ModInfo system.
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Devel::ModInfo::Property has no real corollary in actual Perl code.  It is a logical 
construct which defines a dicrete value in a Perl module that can be accessed and perhaps 
updated via either direct access to the Perl variable, or via accessor/mutator combinations.

An example would be if you defined a lexically scoped variable in your module that you wanted 
to make available via a "get_value" method and make updatable via a "set_value" method.  You 
might name the property "Value" and define the two methods as the read_method and write_method, 
respectively.

There is no run-time Perl syntax support for any ModInfo constructs, certainly not ones that 
do not even exist in Perl.  Properties and other ModInfo features are mainly for design-time 
inspection of the interfaces defined by Perl modules.
