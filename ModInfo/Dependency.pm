=head1 Devel::ModInfo::Dependency

Devel::ModInfo::Dependency - Defines a module's dependency on a particular version of Perl or a
 certain module

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Not meant to be used outside the ModInfo system.
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Devel::ModInfo::Dependency has two types of dependencies at present: PERL and MODULE.  PERL 
dependencies mean that a module requires a certain version of Perl, as declared in Perl 
code using something like the following:

require 5.005;

The MODULE dependency means that the module in question requires another module be 
available, as in defined in Perl using something like this:

use XML::DOM;

These statements appearing in your code are a good indicator that a ModInfo::Dependency 
could be defined.
